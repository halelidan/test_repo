# pMaximizer Update - v.3.0

## What type of upgrade do I need?

There are two types of upgrades available today for the pMaximizer, depending on the user's needs:

1. An existing pMaximizer user wishing to upgrade to our latest version, including the use of a new Google Ads API version (after deprecation of v14), and new features to the dashboard such as the Asset Group Performance table. This update will result in a new Looker Studio dashboard with the latest updates.

2. A non-retail pMaximizer user that wants to upgrade to the retail version. The update for this user will involve creating a new Looker Studio dashboard for the user, with an additional page of retail-related insights.

All upgrades can be done in a few quick and simple steps.

## How To Upgrade:

These are the steps to update your pMaximizer to the new version:
